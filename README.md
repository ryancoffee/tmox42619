## Beamtime  
This repo is predominantly for analysis of the lcls x42619 beamtime performed end of June 2021.  
This will also host code that analyzes for the xcomm118 for runs in the 400's since that was the commissioning shifts.  

# setting up  
First set the configuration .h5 file with something like this...
```bash
./src/set_configs.py /reg/data/ana16/tmo/tmox42619/scratch/ryan_output_2022/h5files/tmox42619.hsdconfig.h5
```
Here one must be sure that the file written is indeed what will be read in ```./src/hits2h5.py```
the ```expname``` gets used to pull the config file, at least until we implement the parser.  

```bash
scratchpath=/reg/data/ana16/tmo/tmox42619/scratch/ryan_output_2022/h5files
expname=tmox42619
runnum=23
shots=100
./src/set_configs.py ${scratchpath}/${expname}.hsdconfig.h5
./src/hits2h5.py ${expname} ${runnum} ${nshots}
```
